# Cypress and JavaScript E2E Test Architecture

Welcome to the Cypress and JavaScript E2E Test Architecture repository! This project showcases a simple and effective structure for end-to-end testing using Cypress and JavaScript, inspired by the principles and best practices discussed in my article on E2E test architecture with Playwright and TypeScript.

## Introduction

Inspired by my previous work with Playwright and TypeScript, this repository demonstrates how to apply a similar E2E test structure using Cypress and JavaScript. The aim is to create a maintainable, scalable, and easy-to-navigate test architecture.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the dependencies:


```git clone https://github.com/skvone/cypress-js-e2e-test-architecture.git```

```cd cypress-js-e2e-test-architecture```

```npm install```

## Running Tests
To run the Cypress tests, use the following command:


```npx cypress open```

This will open the Cypress Test Runner, where you can select and run the tests.

## Key Concepts
### Separation of Concerns
The project structure is designed to separate different aspects of testing:

### API Methods: 
Located in the api directory, these files contain methods for interacting with the application's API.

### UI Methods: 
Located in the ui directory, these files contain methods for interacting with the application's UI components.

### Fixtures: 
Located in the fixtures directory, this file integrates API and UI methods for use in tests.

### Tests: 
Located in the tests directory, this file contains the actual test cases.

### Feature Object Pattern

Instead of the traditional Page Object Model, we use the Feature Object pattern, which focuses on user-oriented features and helps create more maintainable and scalable test code.

### Arrange-Act-Assert

Tests are structured using the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern, making them more readable and easier to understand.
